# Ransomware

## What is ransomware? 

Ransomware is a form of malware installed by a hacker that denies access to files or data on an infected computer or network until the victim pays the hacker a fee, or ransom.<sup>1</sup> Ransomware usually blocks access through encryption, whereby the malware conceals whatever files it can access and tells the victim that access will be regained if they pay the ransom. <sup>2/sup> Ransomware can also work through lock out, whereby the malware locks victims out of their systems so that they cannot access anything on their computer.<sup>3</sup> If the ransom demands are not met, the encrypted data might remain unavailable or be deleted.<sup>4</sup>
