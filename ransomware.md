# Ransomware

## What is ransomware? 

Ransomware is a form of malware installed by a hacker that denies access to files or data on an infected computer or network until the victim pays the hacker a fee, or ransom.<sup>1</sup> Ransomware usually blocks access through encryption, whereby the malware conceals whatever files it can access and tells the victim that access will be regained if they pay the ransom. <sup>2</sup> Ransomware can also work through lock out, whereby the malware locks victims out of their systems so that they cannot access anything on their computer.<sup>3</sup> If the ransom demands are not met, the encrypted data might remain unavailable or be deleted.<sup>4</sup>


## Who in law enforcement should be contacted when an organization is ransomed?

Victims of ransomware should report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a local Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field office, or a local United States Secret Service (USSS) field office.<sup>5</sup>The FBI also recommends that victims file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), with the following ransomware infection details: (1) the victim’s name, telephone number, and email address; (2) financial transaction information, including information concerning the account, transaction date and amount, and who received the payment; (3) information concerning the subject or entity allegedly controlling the ransomware, including the subject’s name, address, telephone number, email, website, and IP address (if available); (4) specific details about the ransomware attack; (5) an email header; and (6) any other relevant information concerning the attack.<sup>6</sup>
