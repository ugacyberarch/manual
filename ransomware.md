# Ransomware

## What is ransomware?

Ransomware is a form of malware installed by a hacker that denies access to files or data on an infected computer or network until the victim pays the hacker a fee, or ransom. Ransomware usually blocks access through encryption, whereby the malware conceals whatever files it can access and tells the victim that access will be regained if they pay the ransom. Ransomware can also work through lock out, whereby the malware locks victims out of their systems so that they cannot access anything on their computer. If the ransom demands are not met, the encrypted data might remain unavailable or be deleted.

## Who in law enforcement should be contacted when an organization is ransomed?

Victims of ransomware should report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a local Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field office, or a local United States Secret Service (USSS) field office. The FBI also recommends that victims file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), with the following ransomware infection details: (1) the victim’s name, telephone number, and email address; (2) financial transaction information, including information concerning the account, transaction date and amount, and who received the payment; (3) information concerning the subject or entity allegedly controlling the ransomware, including the subject’s name, address, telephone number, email, website, and IP address (if available); (4) specific details about the ransomware attack; (5) an email header; and (6) any other relevant information concerning the attack.

## What options does an organization have when it experiences a ransomware attack?

Even with the best cybersecurity measures in place, ransomware attacks are not completely preventable. Businesses affected by a request for ransom should implement a security incident response and business continuity plan. It might take time for the organization’s IT professionals to remove the ransomware threat to the systems and restore data and normal operations. In the meantime, the business should take steps to maintain the organization’s essential functions according to the business continuity plan. Organizations should maintain and regularly test backup plans, disaster recovery plans, and business continuity procedures. When an attack occurs, law enforcement generally discourages paying the ransom because payment does not guarantee that the victim will regain access to their data; in fact, some individuals or organizations are never provided with decryption keys after paying a ransom. Paying a ransom can embolden the hacker to target other victims and provide incentive for other criminals to engage in similar illicit activities for profit.<sup>8</sup>. Though the FBI does not support paying a ransom, it recognizes that executives, when faced with inoperability issues, will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers. Although paying the ransom might not guarantee a return of data, it is up to the victim to determine whether the risks and costs of paying are worth the possibility of getting its files back.
