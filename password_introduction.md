Hands down, the most frustrating daily aspect of online privacy and security is the **password**.

No one likes passwords. Every day we are a little closer to a world where we don't have to use the blasted things.

In fact, there are solutions you can adopt today that will help you be more secure, and let you stop memorizing — or simply forgetting, as is often the case — complicated passwords.

Passwords are ubiquitous today, and understanding the reasoning behind good password discipline is essential to online privacy and security.
