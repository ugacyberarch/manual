# Cyber Security and Privacy

For many of us, privacy and security are an everyday concern. We lock the doors on our homes. We lock our cars. We close our blinds.

However, when it comes to the internet, it isn't always straight forward how to protect ourselves, and for those of us that never have to lock our doors, or close our blinds, it can feel even more unnecessary and inconvenient.

**Why do we lock our doors?**

Oddly enough, those of us that don't need to lock our doors can tell you the answer — **trust**. If you trust your neighbors, and your community, it isn't necessary. The risk is low.

Unfortunately, the internet is a global community with neighbors you **cannot** trust, and criminals on the internet can steal a lot more than your car stereo. The risk is very high.

Some of you may be thinking, "Locking a door won't stop a determined thief from breaking a window!", and the same is true for privacy and security online. We won't talk about how to put bars on every window.

Experts may find the information oversimplified. This guide is not an exhaustive treatment for foolproof security, it is meant to show you the basics of protecting yourself.

**Why are privacy and security important?**

Remember that the world is very inequitable. The incentive for bad actors is greater than you can imagine, and therefore the risk is more than you have considered.

## CyberArch

The University of Georgia launched the Archway initiative to connect the resources of the University to our communities.

Cybersecurity is one of the ways we hope to serve our communities. When we reached out to see how we could help, we found an incredible demand for information.

This is a living document that aims to develop accessible cybersecurity information. Rather than provide a list of recommendations that may seem frivolous and inconvenient, our goal is to provide the context you need to understand the risks you face.
