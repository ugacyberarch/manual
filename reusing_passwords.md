## Reusing Passwords

Undoubtedly, you have encountered a website sign-up that required you to use a combination of capital letters, numbers, and even symbols.

Oh, and don't forget it has to be 8 characters or longer:

Error

* must contain one upper case letter \[A-Z\]
* must contain one lower case letter \[a-z\]
* must contain one number \[0-9\]
* must contain one symbol (e.g. &%$ ...)
* **minimum length of 8**

While this is not bad practice, it can be excessive and extremely frustrating, without adding a lot of security. _Users tend to do the same, predictable, things, like capitalize the first letter, or append their birthday._

We just learned not to use common passwords, but before we talk about why websites want to force you to have complex passwords, let's talk about something that can be more risky â€” **using the same password across websites**.

No one wants to remember a dozen passwords, and those infuriating requirements for passwords make it all the more likely for someone to just start reusing the same password for everything.

**Why is reusing a password such a bad thing?**

## Website Logins

Here is a riddle you may have heard:

> If you have it, You don't share it  
> If you share it, You don't have it  
> What is it?

We dispelled the misconception that password fields are specially protected or private. Moreover, we know that if the site uses `http://` instead of `https://`, all the computers between ours and the website can also see your password.

Suppose that the website does support encryption. Instead of the analogy being mailing a key, we are in fact mailing a lockbox, with your key inside, that only the website should be able to open. Would that keep your key a secret?

**Are your passwords really secret?**
