## Fake Domains

Since the "dot com boom" of the 90s, domain names have been an ever-increasing part of daily life.

**What is a "domain name"?**

* facebook.com
* www.google.com
* www.bbc.co.uk
* en.wikipedia.org

Domain names, sometimes called _hostnames_, are the identifiers we give to systems on the internet. For a few dollars a year, you can register your own domain as easy as ordering a new pair of shoes.

One common way that phishing e-mails attempt to trick recipients is by using domain names that look legitimate but actually lead to counterfeit websites created solely to steal your information.

**Phishing Domain**

Here is an example of a domain that was used to phish for PayPal accounts:

**paypal.com.9kcj.pw**

**How can you tell that `paypal.com.9kcj.pw` is a fake domain?**

You clearly see it contains `paypal.com`, and then you might think the rest is just some technical bit you don't need to worry about.

Alas, the `paypal.com` at the beginning does _not_ mean PayPal owns the domain. Anyone can add `paypal.com` to the _front_ of their domain name! The end of a domain tells you who controls it.

**Reading Domain Names**

You must read domain names right-to-left, separating on the "dots", to understand ownership.

For example, if you read `www.facebook.com` from right to left, you see that `com` controls `Facebook`, which controls `www`.

So, when you read the domain `paypal.com.9kcj.pw` from right to left, you see that `pw` controls `9kcj`, which created a fake extension `paypal.com`.

Most companies use a single "top-level" domain, (e.g. `.com`, `.net`, or `.org`). Be wary if you expect the domain to end in `.com` but it actually ends in something obscure, like `.pw`.

That may seem rather confusing, but it all becomes clear when you understand how domains are created.

## Domain Hierarchy

Domains names are logically a tree. The first level of domains, called "top-level domains", are actually the suffix of the domain name. You will recognize many of them, such as `com`, `net`, and `org`.

The next level, "second-level", are what individuals and companies purchase.

All of the domains below this are controlled by whoever owns the second-level domain.

Try adding `paypal.com` to the _beginning_ of any other domain. Does that change the real `paypal.com`? Does it belong to PayPal?

## Phish / Not Phish

Adding a fake prefix is not the only trick criminals use. Below is a guessing game. Would any of these phish fool you?

## Takeaways

Don't trust a domain simply because it starts with an official name.

Domain ownership is applied right-to-left, and if you are ever in doubt think about it as a tree.

Be wary of domains that end in a top-level you didn't expect (e.g. `.co` instead of `.com`).
