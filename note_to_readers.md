## Note to Readers

If you ever become frustrated with our technology, if it ever seems needlessly complex, we beg you to remember two things:

1. **Consider the concept before the implementation.**  
   Ignore the acronyms and special terms, and think about why we need it. In the end, how we do it is not magic. We just agreed we needed railroads and track standards followed, and that is that. We wanted to connect computers and the protocols we use followed.
2. **Programmers are most often forced to use the tools we have, not the ones we wish we had.**  
   An engineer could no more readily change the width of our nation's railroad tracks than a programmer could alter the infrastructure of the internet. We'd like to make it work easily for everyone, but we work within the boundaries of complex systems we cannot always affect.

We want to show you how to be safe by showing you **why** it is necessary to make certain choices, but sometimes that requires thinking about how the internet works.

Remember that if anything we show you does not make sense, **we** did something wrong, and we want to hear from you. Let us know so that we can improve it.
