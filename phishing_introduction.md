# Phishing

How do you know that the e-mails you receive and the websites you visit are legitimate?

Phishing is a rather silly name for an otherwise very serious risk; it is the name given to the practice of sending fraudulent e-mails that link to fake websites or somehow attempt to trick you into revealing sensitive information.

Instead of baiting a single hook and casting it, these e-mails can be sent to thousands of e-mail addresses in hope that some unsuspecting person will bite.

It is a very effective strategy, and the most successful phishing attacks are often those that use personal information about you or impersonate someone you know or work with.

Quite honestly, you can never be completely sure that the e-mails you receive are legitimate, but there is a very basic knowledge of web technologies that will protect you from being deceived.
