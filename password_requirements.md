## Password Requirements

Everyone can agree that complicated passwords do not make your life any easier.

Although, complicated passwords _can_ make your accounts more secure.

**Do passwords have to be complicated to be secure?**

**Question**

Which password is _stronger_?

**`scrubwithsoaptocleanwell`** or **`P1ckl3$`**

_Wait, was the 'K' capitalized? Did I use a one for the 'I' or the 'L'?_

We will see that strong does not always mean complicated.

So, why do websites make you use numbers, capitals, and special characters? Why do they enforce a minimum length?

Hold on.

**How do we even measure password "strength"?**

## Complexity

Suppose you were given a phone protected by a 4-digit PIN. How long would it take you to try every number?

Password strength is measured by how long it would take a _computer_ to try every possibility.







Four-digit passwords are _not_ secure if you are allowed to keep guessing. You can guess them all very quickly! Fortunately, most devices and services don't allow you to make unlimited guesses. They may make you wait before your next guess, or they may just lock your account.

However, when you create a password, you can never be sure how many times an attacker will have to guess your password.

A password is _strong_ if, given an unlimited number of guesses, it would still be very difficult to guess.

## Money Y'all

Guessing a 4-digit PIN is as simple as counting from 0000 to 9999. Let us consider something harder.

How long would it take a computer to guess today's _Money Y'all_ lottery numbers?

_Money Y'all_ is similar to, but a bit different than, the real lottery. Numbers can be repeated, and you have to guess the numbers in the correct order - like a password or PIN.

Each of the five regular balls is a number from 1 to 69. The "Y'all Ball" is a number 1 to 26.

How many possible numbers are there?

(69 x 69 x 69 x 69 x 69 x 26) = 40,664,815,074

Don't think too much about how the math works; it is just the number of possibilities for each position multiplied across. The same is true for the passwords you create.

That is a lot more than the number of 4-digit PINs (0000 ... 9999):

(10 x 10 x 10 x 10) = 10,000

How fast could a computer find the winning numbers?

That depends on how many guesses your computer can make. A very fast computer could guess billions of times per second.
