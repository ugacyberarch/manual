Ransomware

What is ransomware? 

Ransomware is a form of malware installed by a hacker that denies access to files or data on an infected computer or network until the victim pays the hacker a fee, or ransom. Ransomware usually blocks access through encryption, whereby the malware conceals whatever files it can access and tells the victim that access will be regained if they pay the ransom. Ransomware can also work through lock out, whereby the malware locks victims out of their systems so that they cannot access anything on their computer. If the ransom demands are not met, the encrypted data might remain unavailable or be deleted.
