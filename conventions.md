# Conventions

**Who's That Comin' Down the Track?**

Have you ever stopped to wonder who decided how wide railroad tracks should be?

Some time ago, everyone had to agree that railroad tracks should be a common
width.

How many inventions over the past century have been influenced by the width of
our railways?

Similarly, the internet is a series of abstractions based on conventions agreed
on by the world, and those specifications have limitations and cascading
repercussions for all the technologies that use them.

To understand how to use the internet safely, you will need to understand some
of the conventions (protocols) we use.

For example, we may ask you something like:

> **Question**
>
> What's the difference between these two links?  
> **https://www.paypal.com** and **http://www.paypal.evil.example.com**

You only want to pay your water bill. Why do you need to know?

In this case, you might compare knowing the difference between these links and
spotting a difference between a counterfeit $100 bill and a real $100 bill.

You may end up being scammed if you don't look! It is important.
