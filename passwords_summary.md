# Summary

In short, we have discussed:

* Not using predictable, common passwords.
* Never reusing passwords.
* What makes passwords strong.

It seems like a small list, but now you should know what makes each important.

Hopefully, the technical context will lessen the frustrations you may have with your own passwords.

There is good news. When we started talking about passwords, we mentioned that there were already solutions that would help you.

**Password managers** are an easy and safe way to generate and keep track of strong passwords for all of your accounts.

Companies like [**Dashlane**](https://www.dashlane.com/) and [**1Password**](https://1password.com/families/) have apps and plugins for all of your devices which will manage all of your passwords.

You will no longer have to create or remember passwords. Passwords can be generated automatically and input automatically.

So, you will only need to remember the password for your password manager, which will take care of the rest.

However, just like your primary e-mail, it is absolutely critical that you take special care to protect this all-important "password to rule them all".
