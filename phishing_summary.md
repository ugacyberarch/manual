# Summary

Phishing continues to be a lucrative tactic for online criminals. It is not always easy to differentiate fraudulent correspondence from otherwise legitimate and important communication from the services and people you work with.

It is made even more difficult when attackers tailor language and requests to you personally and insist on urgency.

Your first defense is in distrusting every e-mail you receive.

Look for any indication of deceit. Is the grammar and language used consistent with the suggested source of the e-mail? Are they asking for sensitive information? Do the logos or style seem a bit wrong?

We discussed how criminals create fake domain names and fake links to make the scam more convincing.

Even if you have confidence in the format and content of the e-mail, you should check every link you use; before you click it and in the address bar after the website loads.
