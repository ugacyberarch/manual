  description: For many of us, privacy and security are an everyday concern. We lock
    the doors on our homes. We lock our cars. We close our blinds.However, when it
    comes to the internet, it isn't always straight forward how to protect ourselves,
    and for those of us that never have to lock our doors, or close our blinds, it
    can feel even more unnecessary and inconvenient.
