# Common Passwords

Best practice is to avoid using common passwords. A simple technique for someone trying to break into an account is to try a list of frequently used passwords.

Pretend for a moment that you are trying to create your own list of the most common passwords. The game below allows you to do just that. Guess up to ten passwords and see how popular they are.

The score for each password corresponds to how many times that password has been seen in recent data breaches.

You may be surprised; the reference list contains over 500 million passwords.

## Takeaways

Personal does not always mean unpredictable. Try guessing a pet's name and appending the day of the month you were born. Was it in the list?

Remember that attackers do not have to try every password by hand; they often use programs to automatically try passwords. We'll talk about this more when we discuss password complexity.

You may have also noticed that, although you typed your password into a box that hid the text you entered, it was displayed in clear text on the scoreboard.
